# Supermarket simulation environment for COVID-19 mitigation


This repository contains an agent-based modeling framework for the potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 in commercial establishments such as supermarkets.

The model considers one infected agent and susceptible agents, clients and workers (cashiers). 
Diverse scenarios can be tested for different susceptible population sizes, that is 15, 20, 30, and 50 susceptible agents. In all cases, 3 cashiers are considered. Besides, distancing rules of 30 cm, 50 cm, 1 m, 1.5m, and 2 m are implemented. 
All agents can move through the supermarket corridors following two schemes, the flexible-moving policy, and a restricted-moving policy.
Finally, each simulation file writes the number of agents and the distancing rule in its file name.
